# Maker Community

A community of people that is defined by their love of "hands-on making, creating, designing, and innovating" ([Maker Movement Spreads Innovation One Project at a Time](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F003172171309500306)). Practices include "textile craft, robotics, cooking, woodcrafts, electronics, digital fabrication, mechanical repair, or creation — in short, making nearly anything" ([Maker Movement Spreads Innovation One Project at a Time](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F003172171309500306)). The maker community is deeply investigating in sharing knowledge, either through makerspaces and in-person sharing or online resources (see chapter Collections). Techniques like [[laser_cutting]] or [[3D_printing]] are often used to create something completely new.
