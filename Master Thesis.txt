## Possible Ideas

### Capture & share knowledge in situ

- The internet / Data / Knowledge base of the world is unbelievably huge
- That makes it difficult to combine knowledge & theories or e.g. get an overview of what is out there, how one can find what one is looking for
- Problems: So much knowledge is residing on little islands where only very few people know their way → No exchange between different forms of knowledge
- How could one solve that?
- Can Brain-Computer-Interfaces help?
- Which role does archiving play (Y.N. Harari - Kurze Geschichte der Menschheit) → How can one reduce the need for costly archiving
- Can haptic interfaces help?
- Which software interfaces could help?
- How could that redefine knowledge in the society [Reading Prep Notes](https://www.notion.so/Reading-Prep-Notes-b1ba52755c224dcfbadaedc864617ccd)
- Knowledge Trails (Memex) [https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/)
- Persist shared knowledge from the moment to allow for deeper gain in knowledge and long-term teaching

### Data transfer through unusual material

- Possible materials: Gravitation, Vibration
- Maybe [[ephemeral_interfaces]]

### Maker movement as means of local production

- Regional, sustainable means of making without global consumption

### Other ideas, keywords, etc ...
