# Special Interaction Modalities

Following are rarely used or otherwise special interaction modalities that could be used in technological interactions in an [[hci]] context.

## List of Modalities

### Heartbeat

Can be used as an input or output (see Smartwatch example) for interactive systems. Very personal characteristic, where usage has to follow ethical guidelines. It can be considered as a very affective method of communication (e.g. [Intimate Heartbeats: Opportunities for Affective Communication Technology](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5611482)).

#### Examples

- [Lifetact: utilizing smartwatches as tactile heartbeat displays in video games](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3152832.3152863)
- [Heartbeat: Experience the Pulse of an Electric Vehicle](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2667317.2667331)
