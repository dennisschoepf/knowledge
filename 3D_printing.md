## Materials

### Wood Filaments

#### Creation

- Wood FDM filaments are developed by combining a suitable 3D printing polymer with microwood fibers `Correa, David, et al. "3D-Printed Wood: Programming hygroscopic material transformations." 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing 2.3 (2015): 106-116.`

#### Commercial

- An example wood filament is a copolyester composite with high cellulose content (approx. 40%) that is commercially available under the name Laywood `Correa, David, et al. "3D-Printed Wood: Programming hygroscopic material transformations." 3D Printing and Additive Manufacturing 2.3 (2015): 106-116.`
