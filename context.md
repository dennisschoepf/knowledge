# Context

Context can be defined as: "If a piece of information can be used to characterise the situation of a participant in an interaction, then that information is context" [Understanding and Using Context (Dey, 2001)](http://www.kevinli.net/courses/mobilehci_w2014/papers/dey-context-01.pdf). In that paper preceding definitions are discussed that were described as too specific. This seems to be the general consensus on that topic.
