# Comicboarding

A variation of [[storyboarding]] that focuses on giving a context to a scenario and putting it into a larger storyline ([Comicboarding: Using Comics as Proxies for Participatory Design with Children](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/1240624.1240832)). Aims to give structure and comfort by using a well-known format (comic panels). Isn't used that widely in [[hci]] and where it is used it mainly revolves around children as a target group [[research_methods_children]]. Sample applications shown below are mostly used in a [[participatory_design]] context.

## Applications

- [Co-Designing with Preschoolers Using Fictional Inquiry and Comicboarding](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3025453.3025588)
